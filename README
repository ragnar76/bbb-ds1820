==========

General Information:
	Scripts in PHP and Python to read a DS1820 Temperaturesensor with a
	Beaglebone Black (http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone+Black). In
	the long term, it will grow to a homemade, opensource/openhardware
	weatherstation using an Anemometer, humidity sensor, light sensor
	and other stuff.
